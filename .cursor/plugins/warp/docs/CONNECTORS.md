# Connectors

Warp uses Cursor's native MCP connections. Names in `.warp/config.yaml` are hints for which connected server to call. If a server is missing, say so and write Herald text to `.warp/outbox.md`. Do not mint tokens.

## Jira

Server: `jiraMcp` (Atlassian). Project `HOS`.

- Fetch issue by key, or by tempId label if the key is not on the beam yet.
- Comment: status, PR url, AC evidence, Bugbot result.
- Transition to Done only from Reed, only after merge.
- Do not create tickets. The import already has 366.

## Bitbucket

Server: `bitbucketMcp`. Repos `HumanifyOS` and `HumanifyOS-UI`.

- Open PR from `warp/<id>-<jiraKey>` into `main`.
- Read CI and participant status. APPROVED is the L/XL merge signal.
- Comment Bugbot evidence and AC ids.
- Squash merge only from Reed, only on the policy in MERGE-POLICY.md.

If the Bitbucket MCP cannot open a PR, `git push` and the web UI are a human fallback — raise an alarm rather than scraping credentials into the repo.

## Slack and Teams

`messenger: slack | teams | both`.

Post alarms, approval requests, gate flips, pause/resume, and digests. Command loopback is a message the next tick reads:

- `warp:proceed HOS-14` or `warp:proceed L-01`
- `warp:retry L-01`
- `warp:pause`
- `warp:resume`

A PR comment with the same verb counts. Record the source.

## Bugbot

Use Cursor Bugbot on the PR. Reed stores pass/fail and the evidence string. A pass with no AC ids is not a pass.
