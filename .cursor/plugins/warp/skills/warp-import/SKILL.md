# Warp import

```bash
python3 <plugin>/scripts/scan.py import --plan path/to/WARP_PLAN.json --beam .warp/beam.json
```

Replaces deps, locks, gates, and sizes. Keeps status, PR, tokens, and minutes for ids that still exist. New ids start `queued`. Removed ids drop off. `runState` returns to `stopped`.

Confirm the ticket count, then wait for `/warp-start`. Do not start in the same turn unless the user asked.
