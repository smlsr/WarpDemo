# Export, edit, import

Live state is not source control. Shuttles commit product code on `warp/<id>` branches. Warp does not commit `.warp/` on each tick. Add the snippet in `assets/gitignore-snippet.txt` (`/warp-init` does it) to the repo `.gitignore`.

## Where the files are

| Run | Working copy | How you open files |
|---|---|---|
| Local agent | Your clone on disk | Finder/Explorer, or the Cursor file tree, path `.warp/` |
| Cloud agent | A Cursor VM clone | Cursor file tree for that agent. Download before the VM is discarded. |

`stateDir` in `.warp/config.yaml` defaults to `.warp`. Set an absolute path to keep state outside the repo.

## Files you edit

Edit only the export. Do not hand-edit `beam.json`.

| File | Edit? | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `.warp/WARP_PLAN.json` | Yes, this is the import | Tickets, deps, locks, gates, autoMerge |
| `.warp/WARP_PLAN.md` | Read, optional notes | Brief for another model. Not imported. |
| `.warp/config.yaml` | Yes | Caps, model, messenger. Not replaced by import. |
| `.warp/beam.json` | No | Live status. Import rewrites the graph and keeps status for surviving ids. |
| `.warp/STATUS.md` | No | Generated. Download to review. |

## Steps

1. Pause or stop so a tick cannot claim mid-import. `/warp-pause`
2. Export. `/warp-export` writes `.warp/WARP_PLAN.json` and `.warp/WARP_PLAN.md`.
3. Download those two files from the Cursor file tree (cloud) or copy them (local).
4. Edit `WARP_PLAN.json`. Safe edits: `deps`, `locks`, `size`, `autoMerge`, `critical`, gate `members` and `checks`. Do not rename an id if you want its PR status kept.
5. Upload the edited JSON: drag it into the agent chat, or drop it in the repo as `WARP_PLAN.edited.json`. Do not commit it.
6. Import. `/warp-import` with that path. The run returns to stopped.
7. Read `.warp/STATUS.md`. Confirm counts. `/warp-start` or `/warp-resume`.

Import keeps status, PR url, tokens, and minutes for ids that still exist. New ids start queued. Removed ids drop off.
