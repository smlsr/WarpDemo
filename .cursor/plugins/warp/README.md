# Warp

Warp is a Cursor plugin that scans a repo for a plan, builds a schedule, and dispatches workers under dependency, lock, and gate rules. It is not tied to one product. A third party can point it at their own specs.

Shuttle workers implement one ticket each. Reed reviews and merges, or holds a large ticket for approval. Herald posts to Slack and Teams. The beam survives a stop.

There is no per-person cap. The only concurrency cap is `maxAgents`.

## Install

Type this in a Cursor agent chat. It will not show up in autocomplete, so enter the whole line.

```text
/add-plugin https://github.com/smlsr/Warp
```

That works because the plugin manifest is at the root of that repo (.cursor-plugin/plugin.json), on main. You need Cursor 2.5 or later. Install it for yourself, or for the project, when Cursor asks.
Then, in the repo you want Warp to build, type `/warp-init`. It does the manual steps below and is safe to run again: it checks each one and does only what is missing.

| Step | Skipped when |
|---|---|
| `mkdir -p .cursor/plugins .warp` | both folders exist |
| Copy the plugin to `.cursor/plugins/warp` | every plugin file is already there. Existing files are never overwritten. |
| Copy `assets/config.example.yaml` to `.warp/config.yaml` | the config exists. It is never overwritten. |
| Set `slackChannel` and `teamsChannel` to `warp-<reponame>` | the channel already has a value. Only an empty (default) channel is filled. |
| Append `assets/gitignore-snippet.txt` to `.gitignore` | `.gitignore` already ignores `.warp/`, so the snippet is never added twice |

`<reponame>` comes from the `origin` remote, or the folder name if there is none. It is lowercased, and anything but letters, digits, `_` and `-` becomes `-`. The channel is cut to 50 characters, the Teams limit (Slack allows 80), so it is valid in both. Then reload Cursor.

To do it by hand instead:

```bash
mkdir -p .cursor/plugins .warp
cp -R warp .cursor/plugins/warp
cp .cursor/plugins/warp/assets/config.example.yaml .warp/config.yaml
```

Append `assets/gitignore-snippet.txt` to the repo `.gitignore`. Reload Cursor. Connect Jira, Bitbucket, and Slack or Teams in Cursor Settings.

Commands include `/warp-init`, `/warp-scan`, `/warp-start`, `/warp-pause`, `/warp-resume`, `/warp-stop`, `/warp-status`, `/warp-status-post`, and `/warp-uninstall`.

## Uninstall

`/warp-uninstall` removes `.cursor/plugins/warp` and `.warp/`, and optionally the snippet `/warp-init` added to `.gitignore`, so a fresh `/warp-init` works. It first prints what it will remove and deletes nothing until you confirm. `.warp/` holds the beam, journal, and config, and it cannot be recovered. Stop a running beam first with `/warp-stop`. Product code, `warp/<id>` branches, pull requests, a `stateDir` outside the repo, and a plugin installed through Cursor Settings are not touched. Reload Cursor afterwards.

## Where the files are

A local agent uses your clone. A cloud agent uses a Cursor virtual machine with its own clone. Warp writes `.warp/` in that working copy. It does not commit that directory, and it does not push it. Product code is the only commit: a Shuttle opens `warp/<id>` and a pull request. Status writes stay local. Hundreds of beam updates are not source history.

Review files from the Cursor file tree. On a cloud VM, download them before the VM is discarded. Ask for a bundle and Warp writes `.warp/warp-review.zip` (status, board, plan; no journal). Set `stateDir` to an absolute path to keep the beam outside the repo.

## If you have no plan file

1. Paste `examples/PROMPT-make-cursor-plan.md` into an agent in that repo. It writes `CURSOR_PLAN.md` from the specs and tickets. A filled example is `examples/CURSOR_PLAN.sample.md`.
2. `/warp-scan`, or `/warp-scan <folder>` to look only in one folder (see below). Warp also reads `schedule.json`, a Jira JSON export, or a markdown table with `id` and `deps`.
3. A connected Jira plugin is the live system of record after the scan, not a second scheduler. Warp will not invent tickets.

## Scan one folder

`/warp-scan` searches the whole repo. In a monorepo with specs in several places, give a folder path or name:

```
/warp-scan HOS/spec
/warp-scan spec
```

Only that folder is searched for `CURSOR_PLAN.md`, `schedule.json`, `WARP_PLAN.json`, and Jira exports. `.warp/` stays at the repo root.

- An existing path under the repo is used as given.
- A name is matched against folder names, or the end of their paths, anywhere in the repo.
- If a name matches several folders, Warp lists them, marks which have plan files, and scans nothing. If only one has plan files it uses that one and notes the others. Re-run with the full path to pick.
- With no argument and plans in more than one folder, Warp prints the folders it found and uses the richest plan, as before.

## Session

| Step | In the agent window | What you should see |
|---|---|---|
| Install | `/warp-init`. Reload. | `/warp-scan` and `/warp-start` appear. |
| Scan | `/warp-scan` or `/warp-scan <folder>` | Ticket count, format, run stopped. `beam.json` exists. |
| Start | `/warp-start` | Herald posts. Shuttles claim up to `maxAgents`. |
| Pause | `/warp-pause` | No new claims. In-flight finishes its step. |
| Download | Ask for a bundle, or download `STATUS.md`. | The zip or the file on your machine. |
| Edit | Edit `WARP_PLAN.json` locally. Do not edit `beam.json`. | Changed deps, locks, sizes, or gates. |
| Upload | Drag the JSON into the chat, or drop `WARP_PLAN.edited.json`. Do not commit it. | The agent can see the path. |
| Import | `/warp-import` on that path. | Plan replaced. Run stopped. Status kept for surviving ids. |
| Restart | `/warp-start` | Dispatch uses the new graph. |
| Stop | `/warp-stop` | Stays stopped until the next start. |
| Remove | `/warp-uninstall`, then confirm. | The plugin copy and `.warp/` are gone. `/warp-init` installs again. |

Pause is a hold. Stop is an end. Each repo has its own `.warp/`, so stopping one project does not stop another.

## Export, edit, import

Pause first, so a tick cannot claim while the graph is replaced.

```
/warp-pause
/warp-export
```

Export writes `.warp/WARP_PLAN.json` and `.warp/WARP_PLAN.md`. Download both. Only the JSON is imported. The markdown is the brief for another model.

Safe edits: `deps`, `locks`, `size`, `autoMerge`, `critical`, and gate `members` and `checks`. Keep an id stable if you want its pull request, tokens, and minutes kept. A renamed id is treated as new.

Upload by dragging the file into the agent chat, or saving it in the workspace. Then `/warp-import` on that path. Import rewrites the graph, copies status onto ids that still exist, drops removed ids, and sets the run to stopped. Config is not replaced. Read `.warp/STATUS.md`, then `/warp-start`.

| File | Edit | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `.warp/WARP_PLAN.json` | Yes | The file import reads. |
| `.warp/WARP_PLAN.md` | Read | Analysis brief. Not imported. |
| `.warp/config.yaml` | Yes | Model, cap, messenger. Survives import. |
| `.warp/beam.json` | No | Live status. Scripts write it. |
| `.warp/STATUS.md` | No | Done, working, left. Download to review. |
| `.warp/journal.jsonl` | No | Append-only log. Leave it out of git. |

## Status

`/warp-status` rewrites `.warp/STATUS.md` and `.warp/status.json`. Working means claimed, coding, review, fix, or waiting on approval. Done means merged or moved to Done in Jira. Left is everything else. `.warp/BOARD.md` and `board.html` add gates, alarms, and ETA.

## Status in Teams or Slack

Teams and Slack cannot pull files from a stopped agent. They can ask, and Warp pushes, when the agent is running or a tick fires.

- In the agent window: `/warp-status-post`. Herald posts the digest and attaches `STATUS.md`, `status.json`, and `BOARD.md`.
- In the channel: send `warp:status`. The next tick replies in thread with the same files.
- The same channels accept `warp:pause`, `warp:resume`, `warp:stop`, `warp:start`, `warp:proceed <id>`, and `warp:retry <id>`.

Set `teamsChannel` and `slackChannel` in `.warp/config.yaml`. If a connector is missing, the text is appended to `.warp/outbox.md`. Warp does not store tokens.

## Configuration

One file, `.warp/config.yaml`. Change it, then restart, so the next tick re-reads it.

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `stateDir` | `.warp` | Beam and exports. Gitignore it. |
| `model` | `claude-sonnet-5.5` | Coding slug. Must match the picker. |
| `maxAgents` | `18` | Concurrent Shuttles. The only cap. |
| `autoMergeSizes` | `S, M` | Auto-merge after Bugbot and CI. L and XL wait. |
| `messenger` | `both` | `slack`, `teams`, or `both`. |
| `notify` | `verbose` | Every claim and tick. `quiet` still answers `warp:status`. |
| `runner` | `cloud` | Cloud VM, or `local` for this machine. |
| `jiraProject` | empty | Pin a Jira key, or leave blank. |
| `bugbotRequired` | `true` | No merge without a Bugbot pass. |
| `maxFixAttempts` | `3` | Then the ticket alarms. |
| `stuckAfterMinutes` | `90` | No update in this window raises stuck. |
| `respectMergeWindows` | `false` | True makes new claims wait for a window. |
| `mergeWindows` | `08:30, 13:00, 17:00` | Digest times, or claim gates if the flag is true. |
| `pollSeconds` | `300` | How often pull requests and channel commands are read. |
| `jiraMcp` | `atlassian` | Connected Jira server name. |
| `bitbucketMcp` | `bitbucket` | Connected Bitbucket server name. |
| `slackMcp` / `teamsMcp` | `slack` / `teams` | Connected messenger names. |
| `slackChannel` / `teamsChannel` | empty, or `warp-<reponame>` after `/warp-init` | Channel to post and to watch for `warp:status`. |

## Merge policy

S and M auto-merge after Bugbot and CI are green and every acceptance criterion is on the pull request and the Jira issue. L and XL wait for a Bitbucket APPROVED, or for `warp:proceed <id>`. Three failed reviews raise an alarm. Warp will not retry it until `warp:retry`. A red gate blocks dependents until check evidence is recorded.

## Estimate

Scan and export write an estimate into `.warp/_ingested_schedule.json`, the beam, and `.warp/WARP_PLAN.md`. Agent hours are implementation time (S=4, M=7, L=11, XL=16, unless a ticket has its own hours). Human hours assume every L/XL approval and every gate check is answered within 30 minutes. S/M add no human wait. Elapsed hours are the longer of the critical chain plus those waits, and agent hours divided by `maxAgents`.

## Kickoff

Warp starts each ticket in this repo's workspace, local or cloud, with one line:

```
IMPLEMENT API-01
```

The id is the plan id. The workspace is the clone, so `.cursor/rules`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `.warp/` are on disk. A Shuttle does not inherit the parent chat. Its first step is to read those rules, then the claim in the beam. See `assets/KICKOFF.md`.

Cloud and local are the same contract. A cloud agent is a virtual machine with a clone of the repo. A local agent is your clone. Rules apply because the files are in the workspace, not because they were copied into the prompt. A rule only applies if Cursor would apply it in that workspace: `alwaysApply`, a matching glob, or the Shuttle reading it. Warp requires the read.

## Agents

| Agent | Job |
|---|---|
| Warp | Scan, tick, dispatch, halt. Never edits product code. |
| Shuttle | One ticket, one branch, one pull request. Never merges. |
| Reed | Bugbot, evidence, auto-merge or hold. |
| Herald | Slack and Teams. Status, alarms, approval asks. |
